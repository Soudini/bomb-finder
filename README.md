# Presentation

This is the repository of a school project in the context of a high performance computing course at CentraleSup√©lec.
The aim was to use a fluid dynamic simulation software to find the position of a bomb which exploded. To do that we had the reading of 5 air pressure monitoring stations over time.

To achieve my goal, I implemented a path finding algorithm to downsize the search area and then I used a grid search where we simulated explosion at different positions and then compared the output to the one I had to begin with.

# Usage

the entry point is `find_source.py`
